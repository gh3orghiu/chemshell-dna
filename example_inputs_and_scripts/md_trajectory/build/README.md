The DNA dodecamer '1BNA' from the Protein Databank saved as 1bna.pdb
Use tleap input 'leap.in', to solvate '1bna.pdb' -> '1bna\_solv.pdb'
Run full\_box.sh to determine simulation cell size for NAMD inputs -> These are saved in 'box\_coords.py'.

Manually update simulation configs in 'mineq\_configs' to include correct box size. This has already been done.
