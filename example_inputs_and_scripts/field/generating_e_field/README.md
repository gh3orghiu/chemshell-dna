# Creating an testing the strength of external electric field

In 'testing\_field\_sodium', we show how an electric field can be build into the AMBER force field parameters as charged non-interacting dummy atoms that are arranged in a grid (or plates).<\br>
The strength of the electric field generated by the charged plates can be measured by calculated the force on the Sodium ion.<\br>

In 'dna', we build the electric field using grids around a DNA system of interest.
