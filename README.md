# TCL-ChemShell sample DNA inputs

This repository contains the scripts and information needed to replicate a QM/MM study using ChemShell to investigate the proton transfer between a GC base pair in DNA.</p>

There are two main parts to this work</p>
i) In the instance of no field</p>
ii) In the presence of an external electric field</p>
