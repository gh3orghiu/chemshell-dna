# Multiscale DNA Proton transfer sample inputs and results: Molecular Dynamics and QM/MM

There are two main subfolders here in the root directory.

1. 'example\_inputs\_and\_scripts', where examples of how molecular dynamics calculations can be run using NAMD, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations can be run using ChemShell.
2. 'data\_analysis' includes a condensed form of some of the data acquired during my PhD as well as analysis scripts using jupyter-notebooks.
